# Java-GUI
Created my first java gui for a school project.  Brings up a banking GUI where a customer can deposit, withdraw, transfer and/or view account information.

Admin account is brought up by using 000 as the admin id and "abcd" as the pin.  Once there, the admin can view customers by name, by highest balance, or by most recent transaction.
